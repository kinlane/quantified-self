<p>Summary: Fitbit’s newest fitness-tracking device, the Flex wristband, begins shipping on Monday.It’s more conspicuous than clip-on models — which may not be a bad thing.When I started wearing Fitbit’s clip-on fitness tracker a few months ago, I loved how easy it was to hide.You can clip it to a pants pocket (or ladies can clip it to an undergarment) and no one has to know that it’s there.But I, like a few of my colleagues and other users, soon discovered a downside to Fitbit’s (see disclosure) discreet design — it’s so inconspicuous that you can forget about it entirely.</p>
