It was launched by Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society in 2010, with financial support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and several other funders. It \"aims to unify such disparate sources as the Library of Congress, the Internet Archive, various academic collections, and presumably any other collection that would be meaningful to include. ... They have yet to ... decide such issues as how near to the present their catalog will come. There is an ongoing dispute regarding so-called 'orphan works' and other questions of copyright.\" John Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center, stated in 2011: \"We aspire to establish a system whereby all Americans can gain access to information and knowledge in digital formats in a manner that is 'free to all.' It is by no means a plan to replace libraries, but rather to create a common resource for libraries and patrons of all types.&rdquo;","website":"http:\/\/dp.la\/","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dpla","github":"https:\/\/github.com\/dpla","blog":"","blogrss":"http:\/\/dp.la\/info\/feed","logo":"http:\/\/kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com\/api-evangelist-site\/company\/digital-public-library-of-america-logo.png","screenshot":null,"tags":"Library"},{"id":"1303","name":"The European Library","summary":"The European Library OpenSearch API allows you to develop applications to search and display the European Library collections metadata and previews.
