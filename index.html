<p>There are a new wave of devices that allow the wearer to understand more about themselves, ranging from heart rate to location.  While sports is a common model for many devices, because they have APIs, it opens up this new wave of quantified self devices to be used for everything from tracking to health care.</p>
<p>The Quantified Self is a movement to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (e.g. food consumed, quality of surrounding air), states (e.g. mood, arousal, blood oxygen levels), and performance (mental and physical). Such self-monitoring and self-sensing, which combines wearable sensors and wearable computing, is also known as lifelogging or sousveillance. Other names for using self-tracking data to improve daily functioning are “self-tracking”, “body hacking” and“self-quantifying”.</p> 
<p>In this section I will be tracking on news and companies that are doing interesting things around APIs and the quanitfied self, while also sharing blog analysis as well.</p>
